<h1>JOSH THOMAS - A Completely Serious Introduction</h1>
<p> 
	Josh is a really cool kid. Like REALLY cool. He sits in his girlfriend's parents attic all day and plays on his computer. 
Don't even try to understand how cool that is. Your brain might melt, or at least turn into some sort of Italian dish. 
<i>Spaghetti brains</i>, they'll call you! Your life will be absolutely unlivable from that day onwards, so I really don't recommend 
thinking about how cool Josh is.

<p> 
	Here, I'll list off some of Josh's hobbies. It is a very short list... 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Painting</li>
	<li>Nunchucking</li>
	<li>Taking Apart Electronics</li>
	<li>Coding</li>
	<li>Trying to learn Math</li>
	<li>Posing heroically on beaches</li>
	<li> *AHEM* <i>dreamingAboutWorkingForTheGigBureau</i> </li>
</ul>
<p>
	Isn't <strong>THAT</strong> just a guy you can relate to? I know <strong>I</strong> can relate to him, anyhow. 
</p>
<p>
	But he's not just a human. He's also a human <i>ASSET</i>! He sits at a desk all day making value and whatnot, and all you have 
to feed him is water! Water and a little bit of money. Think of him as a function that takes (<i>$little_money</i>, <i>$water</i>)
 and returns some huge integer of moneys and websites. Clearly Josh is an important function.

	Joking and mental retardation aside, I had a lot of fun working on this teeny-project, and I hope the results are enjoyable!
